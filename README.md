# Lofi-Aleatory
## What will this program do? 
Lofi-Aleatory will will take user input and play a sequence of notes, most of which are randomly selected from a major scale.

## What language will this be written in? 
We will be using C++ to write this program since we are reimagining an existing program that uses C++ and want to have access to the same libraries.
